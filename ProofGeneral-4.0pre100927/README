	    Proof General --- Organize your proofs! 

Proof General is a generic Emacs interface for proof assistants.
The aim of the Proof General project is to provide a powerful, generic
environment for using interactive proof assistants.

This is version 4.0 of Proof General.  See About for exact version.

It is built for Emacs 23.  The code should also work with Emacs 22.3,
but you will need to regenerated the byte-compiled files with "make
clean; make compile".

Supported proof assistants:  Coq, Isabelle, LEGO, PhoX, Plastic

A few example proofs are included in each prover subdirectory.  The
"root2" proofs of the irrationality of the square root of 2 were
proofs written for Freek Wiedijk's challenge in his comparison of
different theorem provers, see http://www.cs.kun.nl/~freek/comparison/.  
Those proof scripts are copyright by their named authors.  (NB: most
of these may have rusted)
